# Visual & Rendering Pipeline Spec — "Stunning" 3D Graph for Obsidian

Perspective: visual design + render pipeline. Every value below is a concrete starting point an implementer can type in without taste of their own; values marked **[tune@gate]** are expected to be adjusted at Rick's preview gate.

Ground truth pulled from the live vault:
- `/Users/rick/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/Rick's Second Brain/.obsidian/graph.json` — 9 path colorGroups (decoded to hex below), `showTags:false`, `showAttachments:false`, `hideUnresolved:false` (unresolved ARE shown), `showOrphans:true`, `showArrow:false`.
- `appearance.json` — `theme:"system"`, `cssTheme:"Minimal"`, `accentColor:""` (default accent → always read CSS vars at runtime, never hardcode accent).
- Vault has ungrouped folders (60流浪, 80随记, 90故纸堆, 99Archive, Readwise, root-level files) that need a designed "neutral" node treatment.

## 0. Decoded color groups (authoritative palette)

`graph.json` stores colors as `rgb` integers. Decode: `r=(v>>16)&255, g=(v>>8)&255, b=v&255`. Verified values:

| Group | int | hex | hue |
|---|---|---|---|
| 01学习 | 14048348 | `#D65C5C` | red 0° |
| 02工作 | 14069084 | `#D6AD5C` | amber 40° |
| 03产品 | 11392604 | `#ADD65C` | lime 80° |
| 04AI | 6084188 | `#5CD65C` | green 120° |
| 05读书 | 6084269 | `#5CD6AD` | mint 160° |
| 06人 | 6073814 | `#5CADD6` | sky 200° |
| 30认真活着 | 6053078 | `#5C5CD6` | indigo 240° |
| Cubox | 11361494 | `#AD5CD6` | purple 280° |
| 00Meta | 15101696 | `#E66F00` | orange (saturated) |

All nine are the standard Obsidian swatch family hsl(h, 60%, 60%) except Meta. This is a well-spaced hue wheel — keep the hues, transform saturation/lightness per direction (Section 5). Color-group queries are `path:` prefixes with trailing spaces — trim before matching, match on `TFile.path.startsWith(folder + "/")`, first match wins (Obsidian semantics: top group wins).

## 1. Scene composition spec (Direction A baseline; B deltas in Section 4)

### 1.1 Background
- `scene.background = new THREE.Color(0x000003)` (NASA near-black; NOT pure black — pure black deadens bloom falloff). No fog. No vignette. No film grain. Premium = restraint.

### 1.2 Starfield
- One `THREE.BufferGeometry` per size class, 3 classes → **3 draw calls total**:
  - Class S: 2,600 pts, size 1.2px, `sizeAttenuation:false`
  - Class M: 900 pts, size 2.0px, `sizeAttenuation:false`
  - Class L: 250 pts, size 3.0px, `sizeAttenuation:false`
- Distribution: random on a spherical shell radius `6.5 × graphRadius` (graphRadius = bounding-sphere radius of laid-out graph, recomputed once after layout settles). Shell, not volume — effectively infinite, near-zero parallax (NASA treats stars as skybox).
- Colors: 85% cool whites lerp(`#9DA8C4`→`#FFFFFF`), 10% warm `#FFE9C9`, 5% blue `#BFD3FF`. Per-vertex color, `vertexColors:true`.
- Brightness: base opacity 0.55; ~3% of Class L stars get color × 1.8 (HDR-ish, they alone catch bloom → a few "real" bright stars). **[tune@gate]**
- Motion: entire starfield group rotates at 0.0008 rad/s around Y — alive but imperceptible. No twinkle shader in V1 (cost/benefit fails).
- Optional flourish (T3, default on, costs nothing): bias 30% of Class S points toward an inclined plane (tilt 28°, gaussian σ = 0.18 × shellRadius) → faint Milky Way band.

### 1.3 Nodes — "luminous orbs", not geometric spheres
The NASA look is a soft-edged glowing disc, which is exactly what a point sprite gives us. **Render all nodes as ONE `THREE.Points` with a custom ShaderMaterial (1 draw call for 3,225 nodes).** This is simultaneously the look AND the performance answer; predecessors died doing per-node meshes.

- Fragment shader (the entire node look lives here):
  - `d = length(gl_PointCoord - 0.5)`
  - hot core: `coreMix = smoothstep(0.18, 0.0, d)` → `color = mix(groupColor, white, coreMix * 0.55)` (white-hot center is what makes bloom read as "energy", not "blur")
  - edge: `alpha = smoothstep(0.5, 0.42, d)` (soft but defined rim)
  - per-vertex attributes: `color (vec3)`, `size (float)`, `dimFactor (float)` for focus mode.
- Size by degree: `radius = 2.2 * (1 + 0.5 * sqrt(degree))`, clamped to `[2.2, 13.2]` world units (6× cap so MOC hubs don't eclipse the scene). Multiply by user's `nodeSizeMultiplier` (0.93) read from graph.json. `gl_PointSize = radius * scaleFactor / -mvPosition.z`, `sizeAttenuation` manual in shader.
- **Proximity promotion pool**: `gl_PointSize` clamps at the GPU max (often 64–512px) — a node you fly right up to would shrink. Keep a pool of **32 `THREE.Sprite`s** (same radial texture baked to a 128px canvas) and each frame promote any node whose projected radius > 48px out of the Points layer (set its point alpha 0, position sprite). Selected + hovered nodes are always promoted. Pool = 32 draw calls worst case, usually <6.
- States:
  - **Hover**: additive halo `THREE.Sprite` (one shared, repositioned), scale 2.6 × nodeRadius, radial gradient groupColor → transparent, peak alpha 0.35, fade-in 120ms ease-out. Cursor: pointer.
  - **Selected**: halo sprite at 3.2 × radius, alpha 0.5, slow breathe: scale ×(1.0→1.06→1.0) sine period 2.4s. Core brightens: vertex color × 1.25.
  - **Focus mode (selection active)**: non-neighbors set `dimFactor → 0.12` (shader: `color = mix(bgColor, color, dimFactor)`, alpha × dimFactor max 0.35); 1-hop neighbors stay 1.0. Animate dimFactor over 280ms ease-out (CPU lerp into the attribute array, 3.2k floats — trivial). ESC / click-void restores over 280ms.
  - **Search match**: matched nodes flash to `--graph-node-focused` (fallback: `--interactive-accent`) ring halo for 1.2s, then fly-to the top hit.

### 1.4 Links — thin, desaturated, ONE draw call
**Hard requirement: all ~43,000 links in a single `THREE.LineSegments`** (one BufferGeometry: positions Float32Array 43k×2×3, colors 43k×2×4 RGBA). Per-link `THREE.Line` objects (3d-force-graph default) is forbidden — it is the documented cause of predecessor abandonment. Positions are rewritten from the force-engine output each tick; colors rewritten only on selection-state changes.

- Width: 1px (`LineBasicMaterial`; linewidth>1 is unsupported on most platforms anyway — and NASA trails are thin).
- Color: `mix(groupColor(src), groupColor(dst), 0.5)` then desaturate 60% and clamp luminance to ~0.35 → dusty, recedes behind nodes.
- Blending: **NormalBlending, global opacity feel 0.16** via per-vertex alpha (additive blending across 43k lines white-out at the hub core — tested failure mode). Settings toggle "链接辉光" switches to AdditiveBlending at alpha 0.05 for those who want it. **[tune@gate]**
- Depth: `depthWrite:false`, render order links < nodes (nodes always punch through the web).
- Highlight states (vertex-color rewrite, ~O(degree)):
  - selected node's own links: full-saturation groupColor, alpha 0.85
  - links between two neighbors: alpha 0.45
  - all other links in focus mode: alpha 0.04
- showArrow=false per user config: no arrowheads in V1 at all (they're visual noise at this density).
- T3 (settings-gated, default off): on selection, 40 transient particles run along the selected node's links (one shared Points buffer, 2s lifetime, then freed). Never ambient/global particles — that's the TagsRoutes look, not NASA.

### 1.5 Special node types
- **Unresolved** (shown, per `hideUnresolved:false`): ghost treatment — no hot core in shader (`coreMix×0`), alpha ×0.45, color `--graph-node-unresolved` (fallback `#7A8499`). Reads as "not yet real".
- **Orphans** (shown): normal rendering; force layout naturally drifts them outward — that IS their visual identity. No special styling.
- **Attachments / tags**: OFF by default (mirrors graph.json). If user enables in settings: attachments use a diamond sprite-mask variant, `--graph-node-attachment`; tags use a hollow-ring mask, `--graph-node-tag`. Implemented as a `shapeId` vertex attribute branching the fragment mask (still 1 draw call).

## 2. Post-processing chain

Built on `Graph.postProcessingComposer()` (3d-force-graph exposes its EffectComposer; it already contains the RenderPass).

**Pass order (Direction A, desktop High tier):**
1. `RenderPass` (provided by 3d-force-graph)
2. `UnrealBloomPass(new Vector2(w, h), strength, radius, threshold)`
   - **threshold: 0.10** — links at lum 0.35 × alpha 0.16 stay under; node cores and bright stars bloom.
   - **strength: 0.9** — exposed as settings slider 「辉光强度」 range 0–2.5, step 0.05, live-updating (`bloomPass.strength = v`). This is THE user-facing cinematic dial (NASA does exactly this).
   - **radius: 0.45** — tight glow; >0.7 reads as smear. **[tune@gate]**
3. `OutputPass` (three r152+ requirement: composer output bypasses renderer color-space conversion; without OutputPass everything renders washed-out linear).

- Tone mapping: `renderer.toneMapping = ACESFilmicToneMapping, exposure 1.05` in Direction A (filmic rolloff on bloom highlights). Caveat: ACES shifts hues slightly — acceptable in A (no theme-fidelity promise). If group colors drift objectionably at the gate, fall back to `NoToneMapping`. Direction B-light: `NoToneMapping` always (color fidelity on paper).
- Anti-aliasing: composer render target `samples: 4` (WebGL2 MSAA) on High tier; no FXAA pass (bloom already softens edges; FXAA blurs labels' canvas edge for nothing).
- **No OutlinePass.** NASA keeps it disabled until selection; our halo-sprite selection is cheaper and softer. OutlinePass at 3.2k objects re-renders the scene 2 extra times — cut entirely.
- **Cost notes / quality tiers:**
  - UnrealBloom ≈ 5 internal blur passes over mip chain; dominant cost is fill-rate at full res.
  - **High** (desktop default): bloom resolution = full, samples 4, pixelRatio = min(devicePixelRatio, 2).
  - **Medium** (auto-fallback): bloom resolution = `Vector2(w/2, h/2)` (half-res bloom is visually ~indistinguishable at radius 0.45), samples 0, pixelRatio ≤ 1.5.
  - **Mobile**: composer bypassed entirely — `renderer.render()` direct (Section 7).
  - Auto-tier watchdog: if mean fps < 45 sustained 5s → drop one tier, notice 「已自动降低画质以保持流畅」; manual override in settings (高/中/自动/移动).
- Resize: on `ItemView` resize observer → `composer.setSize`, `bloomPass.resolution.set`, camera aspect update.
- Lifecycle: `onClose()` must dispose composer render targets, all geometries/materials/textures, call `renderer.dispose()`, `forceContextLoss()` is NOT needed but `webglcontextlost`/`restored` handlers are (Electron GPU resets) — predecessors leaked exactly here.

## 3. Camera choreography

All camera moves via our own tween wrapper (easeInOutCubic: `t<.5 ? 4t³ : 1-(-2t+2)³/2`) driving `Graph.cameraPosition(pos, lookAt, 0)` per frame — do not rely on the library's internal tween (we need interrupt/compose semantics).

### 3.1 Establishing shot (first impression — highest value moment)
1. Layout pre-warms hidden: run force engine (in worker) until `alpha < 0.05` or 1.8s wall-clock max; canvas covered by a `#000003` overlay div with a subtle pulsing 「构建星图…」 label.
2. Reveal: overlay fades 600ms; simultaneously camera **pulls back from inside the graph**: start at `0.5 × graphRadius` from centroid (inside the web, links streaming past), end at `2.2 × graphRadius`, elevation +18° above the dominant plane, duration **3.2s, easeInOutSine**. Bloom strength animates 1.6 → 0.9 over the same window (bright birth, settles to cruise).
3. Hand off directly into idle cruise (no dead stop).
4. Establishing shot plays only on view-open, not on every data refresh. Skippable: any pointer input cuts to final framing in 250ms.

### 3.2 Fly-to (search hit / double-click / card 「聚焦」)
- Target camera distance: `d = clamp(nodeRadius × 12, 40, 140)` world units — hubs framed wider, leaf notes intimate.
- Approach vector: keep the camera's current direction to the node but rotate **15° azimuth offset** so arrival never centers the node dead-on occluding its neighborhood; final `lookAt = node position`.
- Duration: `clamp(800 + 0.45 × travelDistance, 800, 1800)` ms, easeInOutCubic. Long jumps take visibly longer — that's the "travel" feel; never exceed 1.8s (impatience threshold).
- Interruptible: new input kills the tween at current position (no snap).
- On arrival: select the node (halo + focus dim + card).

### 3.3 Idle cruise 「巡航」
- Orbit around graph centroid: angular speed **0.022 rad/s** (~4.8 min/revolution — barely conscious motion).
- Organic drift, not a turntable: elevation oscillates ±8° (sine, period 90s); orbit radius breathes ±4% (sine, period 60s). Two incommensurate periods → path never visibly repeats.
- If a node is selected when idle kicks in: orbit the **selected node** at its fly-to distance instead (NASA "tracking an asteroid" feel), speed 0.03 rad/s.
- Pause: any pointerdown/wheel/touchstart. Resume: after **10s** of no input, easing from 0 → full angular speed over 2s (no jerk).
- Toggle: settings + command 「切换巡航模式」; state shown as a small status icon in the view's action bar.

---

## 4. The two visual directions (Rick's preview gate)

Both ship behind one `preset: 'deep-space' | 'adaptive'` flag in settings + command 「切换视觉方案」 for instant A/B from the running vault. All preset-divergent values live in ONE tokens file (`src/render/presets.ts`) — nothing preset-specific hardcoded elsewhere.

### Direction A 「深空」 — always-dark cinematic
Everything in Sections 1–3 as written. The view is a cinema pane: it stays deep space even when the app is in light mode (deliberate contrast, like a video player). UI chrome (cards/labels/toolbar) is dark glass regardless of theme: `background rgba(10,14,24,0.72)`, `backdrop-filter: blur(16px)`, border `1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.08)`, text `#E8ECF6`. Node colors: group hexes used as-is (the hot-core shader supplies brilliance).

### Direction B 「适应」 — theme-adaptive
- **Dark mode**: identical code path to A (shared scene), bloom default 0.8, UI cards use Obsidian vars (`--background-primary`, `--background-modifier-border`) instead of fixed glass.
- **Light mode 「晨昼制图室」** — designed as ink-on-paper cartography, NOT a dimmed dark scene:
  - Background: warm paper `#F6F4EF`, with a barely-there radial grade to `#EDEAE3` at frame edges (6% — grounds the scene; this is the one place a vignette-like device is allowed).
  - **No starfield.** Replacement atmosphere: 600 "dust motes" — tiny `#D8D4CB` points, `sizeAttenuation:true`, drifting at 0.15 world-units/s with per-point phase → depth and life without faking night.
  - **Bloom OFF** (bloom on light bg = haze/dirt). Crispness replaces glow: node shader light-variant — no white-hot core; instead solid ink disc with a 1px darker rim (`rim = smoothstep` band at d∈[0.40,0.46], color × 0.75) and a soft contact-shadow halo sprite beneath hovered/selected nodes (multiply-blend, black 8% alpha, 2× radius) — nodes sit ON the paper.
  - Node colors: same 9 hues re-targeted for paper contrast — keep hue, S≈57%, **L 60%→44%**: 学习 `#B03030`, 工作 `#B08630`, 产品 `#86B030`, AI `#30B030`, 读书 `#30B086`, 人 `#3086B0`, 认真活着 `#3030B0`, Cubox `#8630B0`, Meta `#CC6300`. **[tune@gate]**
  - Links: ink construction lines — `#2E2A24` at alpha 0.10; highlight state = full saturated group color alpha 0.8 (colored ink over pencil — the selection moment is genuinely beautiful in light mode).
  - Selection emphasis (no bloom available): dual-ring halo sprite — inner ring groupColor alpha 0.9, outer ring `#1F2933` alpha 0.25 — plus the breathe pulse.
  - Labels `#1F2933` with paper-halo `text-shadow: 0 0 6px rgba(246,244,239,0.95)`; card = native Obsidian light card (`--background-primary` + `--shadow-s`).
  - Tone mapping: `NoToneMapping`. AA matters more without bloom: keep samples 4 even on Medium tier in light mode.
- Switch trigger: `workspace.on('css-change')` + `body.theme-dark` check. Transition: container fades to 0 over 180ms → swap scene tokens (background, materials' uniforms, starfield↔motes visibility, bloom on/off) → fade in 220ms. No WebGL teardown.

**The gate**: milestone M3 ships both presets toggleable live; Rick compares in his real vault (dark A vs dark B are near-identical — the real decision is "do I want a light mode at all, and is 晨昼 good enough to exist"). Decision recorded in WORKLOG.md; losing preset is kept behind the flag (cost ≈ one tokens object), so this is a default-choice gate, not a deletion gate.

---

## 5. Color system & CSS-var pipeline

- **Source of truth order**: (1) colorGroups parsed from `graph.json` via `vault.adapter.read(normalizePath(configDir + '/graph.json'))` in try/catch (undocumented format — on any parse failure fall back silently to step 2); (2) `--graph-*` CSS vars from `getComputedStyle(document.body)`: `--graph-node`, `--graph-node-unresolved`, `--graph-node-attachment`, `--graph-node-tag`, `--graph-node-focused`, `--graph-line`, `--graph-text`; (3) hardcoded fallbacks (`#9AA4B2` neutral / values above).
- Ungrouped nodes (60流浪, 80随记, 90故纸堆, 99Archive, Readwise, root files): `--graph-node` neutral — A: `#9AA4B2`, B-light: `#6B7280`. Neutral nodes get a weaker hot core (coreMix × 0.6) so the 9 colored constellations visually lead.
- Direction A consumes only `--graph-node-focused`/accent from the theme (search/selection highlight); B consumes the full var set. Re-read all vars on `css-change` (registered via `registerEvent` → auto-cleanup).
- Saturation policy: nodes carry full group color; **links carry the desaturated version** (Section 1.4); glow inherits node color automatically through bloom — never tint bloom separately (one global pass; per-color bloom is a selective-bloom trap, skip).
- Color updates on vault changes (file moved between group folders via `vault.on('rename')`): rewrite that node's vertex color in-place; no rebuild.

---

## 6. Label & selection-card system (DOM overlay)

In-canvas text is forbidden (NASA verdict + crisp CJK text needs DOM). Architecture:

- One absolutely-positioned overlay `<div class="sg-overlay">` covering the canvas, `pointer-events:none`; interactive children (card buttons) re-enable `pointer-events:auto`.
- **Tracked-node budget, hard cap 40 DOM elements**: selected (1) + hovered (1) + selection's neighbors (≤20, by degree if more) + persistent hub labels (top-14 nodes by degree; recomputed only on data change). Each frame: `vector.copy(node).project(camera)` → if `z>1` or offscreen → `display:none`; else `transform: translate3d(xpx, ypx, 0)` (GPU compositing, no layout thrash). 40 projections/frame is negligible.
- Label LOD (per label, evaluated per frame, all transitions via CSS opacity 150ms):
  - hide when projected node radius < 4px (too far to matter)
  - hub labels: alpha = `smoothstep(2.6R → 1.2R)` of camera-to-node distance (R = graphRadius) — far away only the brightest constellation names float, exactly the NASA far-view
  - neighbor labels appear only while a selection is active
  - font: `var(--font-interface)`; two discrete sizes only — 11px (far/neighbor), 13px (hover/selected/near) — continuous font scaling jitters, forbidden. Label text = basename without extension, ellipsis at 18ch.
- **Selection card** (single instance, reused):
  - Anchor: projected node position + 16px right offset; flip to left when overflowing; clamp 12px viewport margin; tracks node every frame while layout drifts.
  - Content: title (15px, 600 weight) · folder path with group-color dot (12px muted) · tag chips from `getAllTags(getFileCache(file))`, max 5 · stats row 「↩ N 反链 · → M 出链 · 修改于 …」 · snippet: first ~120 chars via `vault.cachedRead`, markdown-stripped, loaded async + cancellable (show skeleton 1 line meanwhile) · actions: 「打开笔记」(`workspace.openLinkText`, new leaf on mod-click) + 「聚焦」(fly-to).
  - Styling: A = dark glass (Section 4); B = Obsidian-native vars. Enter animation: 160ms scale 0.96→1 + fade. Width 280px desktop.
- Mobile replaces the floating card with a **bottom sheet** (Section 7).

---

## 7. Mobile degraded tier — "premium small", not "broken big"

Trigger: `Platform.isMobile` (manifest `isDesktopOnly:false`).

**Keep (the soul):** `#000003` + starfield (1,200 pts, 2 size classes — Points are cheap everywhere) · establishing shot (shortened to 2.0s) · fly-to + idle cruise (cruise default ON — it's the showpiece on a phone) · 9-color groups + focus-mode dimming · search.

**The key trick — glow without bloom:** mobile skips the composer entirely, but the node fragment shader's white-hot core + soft falloff already reads as luminous, and the L-class stars keep their sparkle via the same baked falloff. 80% of the look survives at 0% postprocessing cost.

**Cut/adapt:** no EffectComposer (direct render, no OutputPass needed) · pixelRatio = min(dpr, 1.5) · MSAA off · link budget: render top 12,000 links ranked by `min(degree(src),degree(dst))` descending (hub structure survives; hairline periphery goes) — selected node's links always force-included · promotion pool 8 sprites · hub labels top-6, neighbor labels ≤8 · selection card = bottom sheet (`max-height 40vh`, drag-down dismiss, same content minus snippet) · tap = select, double-tap = fly-to, pinch/two-finger = library default orbit controls.
Direction B light-mode applies identically on mobile (it never had bloom to lose).

---

## 8. Render architecture (the interface that keeps us alive)

- `LayoutEngine` interface (positions in, tick events out) — d3-force-3d first on main thread (M1), then moved into a Web Worker via inlined Blob URL (M2); force params seeded from graph.json (`repelStrength 14.8 → charge ≈ -14.8×k`, `linkDistance 264 → scaled to scene units`, `centerStrength 0.73`) so the 3D layout's "shape" feels familiar from day one.
- `GraphRenderer` interface with two implementations: `LibRenderer` (stock 3d-force-graph objects — dev/debug only, link-capped) and `AggregateRenderer` (Section 1: 1×Points nodes + 1×LineSegments links + sprite pools) — **AggregateRenderer is the V1 ship target, not a contingency**, because 43k per-link objects is a proven killer.
- Total V1 desktop draw-call budget: 3 starfield + 1 nodes + 1 links + ≤34 sprites + bloom internals ≈ **<45 calls**. Debug command 「显示性能面板」 overlays fps / `renderer.info.render.calls` / triangles / tier — this is also how every visual milestone gets verified.

## 9. Milestone verification (per Rick's protocol)
- M1 walking skeleton: manual — view opens, graph visible, no console errors; automated — color-int decode + group-matching unit tests.
- M2 AggregateRenderer + bloom: perf panel shows ≥55fps sustained 60s in the real 3.2k/43k vault, draw calls <45; manual checklist: hot cores visible, links recede, no hub white-out.
- M3 **preview gate**: both presets live-toggleable; Rick runs 10-minute side-by-side script (open → establishing shot → search 「产品」 → fly-to → hover 5 nodes → select hub → focus dim → idle 30s) in dark AND light app theme; picks default. 
- M4 labels/cards/choreography: manual checklist per Section 3/6 behaviors; automated test for projection math + LOD thresholds.
- M5 mobile: same script on iPhone via iCloud-synced vault, target ≥30fps.

### Critical Files for Implementation
(repo not yet created; `<repo>` = `/Users/rick/Claude_Code/<plugin-id>` — plugin id TBD, must not contain "obsidian")

- /Users/rick/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/Rick's Second Brain/.obsidian/graph.json — live input: colorGroups, force params, display toggles (read-only, best-effort parse)
- `<repo>`/src/render/presets.ts — single source of ALL visual tokens for Direction A 「深空」 and B 「适应/晨昼」 (colors, bloom params, blending, label styles)
- `<repo>`/src/render/AggregateRenderer.ts — Points node shader, LineSegments link buffer, halo/promotion sprite pools, focus-mode attribute animation
- `<repo>`/src/render/PostFX.ts — composer chain (RenderPass→UnrealBloom→OutputPass), quality tiers, watchdog, resize/dispose lifecycle
- `<repo>`/src/camera/Choreographer.ts + `<repo>`/src/overlay/LabelLayer.ts — establishing shot, fly-to, idle cruise; DOM label/card projection loop

## KEY DECISIONS
- Render all 3,225 nodes as ONE THREE.Points draw call with a custom radial-falloff shader (white-hot core + soft rim), and all ~43k links as ONE LineSegments buffer — the AggregateRenderer is the V1 ship target, not a later optimization. — 3d-force-graph creates a THREE.Line object per link; at 43k links that is exactly the wall every predecessor plugin died on. The point-sprite falloff is simultaneously the NASA 'luminous orb' aesthetic and the perf answer (total scene <45 draw calls), and it gives mobile glow without any postprocessing.
- Post chain is exactly RenderPass → UnrealBloomPass(threshold 0.10, strength 0.9 user slider, radius 0.45) → OutputPass; no OutlinePass, no FXAA, no fog/vignette/grain. — Verified NASA Eyes recipe: bloom-as-user-slider plus restraint. OutlinePass re-renders the scene twice for an effect a halo sprite does better; OutputPass is mandatory in three r152+ or composer output is washed-out linear; low threshold lets node cores bloom while 0.16-alpha desaturated links stay quiet.
- Links use NormalBlending at ~0.16 alpha (additive offered only as an opt-in toggle), colored as 50/50 endpoint-group mix desaturated 60%. — 43k additive lines accumulate to white-out at the vault's dense hub core — a known failure mode. Desaturated normal-blend lines recede behind nodes, matching NASA's thin desaturated trails, while selection rewrites vertex colors to full saturation for contrast where it matters.
- Direction B light mode is a designed 'ink-on-paper cartography' scene (warm paper #F6F4EF, dust motes instead of stars, bloom OFF, rim-inked nodes at L44%, pencil-line links) — not a brightened dark scene. — Rick's protocol demands two genuinely distinct previewable directions; bloom on a light background reads as haze, so the light treatment must derive its premium feel from crispness (rims, contact shadows, colored-ink highlights) rather than glow.
- Both presets live behind one tokens file (src/render/presets.ts) and a runtime toggle command, shipped together at milestone M3 as the formal preview/decision gate. — Rick (PM, decides by looking at running versions) must compare 深空 vs 适应 inside his real 3,225-note vault in both app themes; keeping divergence confined to one tokens object makes the dual build nearly free and the losing preset cheap to keep.
- Camera choreography: 3.2s inside-out pull-back establishing shot with bloom settling 1.6→0.9, fly-to distance = clamp(nodeRadius×12, 40, 140) with 15° azimuth offset and distance-proportional 0.8–1.8s easeInOutCubic, idle cruise at 0.022 rad/s with incommensurate ±8°/±4% drift periods, pause-on-input/resume-after-10s. — First impression carries the 'stunning' verdict; concrete numbers (speeds, clamps, easings) remove implementer taste from the loop, and the two incommensurate drift periods make the cruise path never visibly repeat — the difference between 'screensaver' and 'spacecraft'.
- Labels and the selection card are DOM overlay elements with a hard 40-element budget (selected + hovered + ≤20 neighbors + top-14 hubs), projected per frame via translate3d, two discrete font sizes only. — Verified NASA pattern (DOM labels, not in-canvas text); DOM gives crisp CJK rendering and Obsidian CSS-var theming for free; the fixed budget keeps per-frame projection cost negligible and prevents the label-soup failure of the core graph at 3k nodes.
- Decode and consume the user's existing graph.json (9 colorGroups verified to exact hexes #D65C5C…#E66F00, nodeSizeMultiplier, force params, showTags/showAttachments/hideUnresolved flags) as the default visual state, with --graph-* CSS vars and hardcoded values as fallback chain. — Rick's mental map of his vault is already trained on these 9 hues and display choices; inheriting them makes the 3D view feel like 'my graph, ascended' on first open rather than a foreign tool, and the try/catch fallback chain absorbs the undocumented-format risk.
- Mobile tier skips the EffectComposer entirely and relies on the shader-baked hot core for glow, caps links at top-12k by hub importance, halves star count, and swaps the floating card for a bottom sheet. — Postprocessing fill-rate is the dominant mobile cost; because the node look lives in the fragment shader rather than in bloom, ~80% of the aesthetic survives at zero postprocessing cost, keeping the degraded tier 'premium small' instead of 'broken big'.

## RISKS
- Hub white-out / visual mud at the vault's dense core (43k links converging): even with normal blending, the center may clip to a blob under bloom. Mitigation: low link alpha (0.16) + bloom threshold 0.10 are chosen against this; verify at M2 with the REAL vault (not synthetic data), and keep a per-link alpha attenuation by hub degree as a ready fallback knob.
- GPU max point size clamps node sprites when the camera flies close, making near nodes shrink — would silently ruin every fly-to arrival. Mitigation: the 32-slot proximity promotion pool (Points→Sprite swap above 48px projected radius) is specced as core behavior, not an extra; test on Intel iGPU where MAX_POINT_SIZE is smallest.
- ACES tone mapping shifts the 9 group hues, breaking the 'my colors, ascended' promise in Direction A. Mitigation: tone mapping is a single preset token; the M3 gate script explicitly compares scene colors against the 2D graph, with NoToneMapping as the one-line fallback.
- graph.json format is undocumented and may change in any Obsidian release (currently 1.13.1), silently dropping Rick's color groups. Mitigation: best-effort try/catch parse with full hardcoded fallback of the decoded palette baked into presets.ts, plus a settings notice when inheritance fails; never crash the view on parse errors.
- Per-frame attribute uploads (43k×2 link positions every tick) could bottleneck on bufferSubData bandwidth, capping fps below 55 on older desktops. Mitigation: stop uploading once layout alpha settles (static graph = zero uploads), mark buffers DynamicDrawUsage, and the auto-tier watchdog degrades bloom before the experience degrades.
- Direction B light mode may simply look worse than A no matter the polish, wasting build effort. Mitigation: B-dark shares ~95% of A's code path, so the incremental cost is only the light-token set and the no-bloom node shader variant; the M3 gate is explicitly allowed to conclude 'A always, B never ships as default' while keeping B behind the flag.
- Memory/context leaks on view close or Electron GPU resets (the documented sin of predecessor plugins). Mitigation: disposal checklist is part of M2's definition of done — composer render targets, geometries, materials, textures, worker termination, webglcontextlost/restored handlers — verified by open/close cycling 20× while watching renderer.info.memory in the perf panel.
